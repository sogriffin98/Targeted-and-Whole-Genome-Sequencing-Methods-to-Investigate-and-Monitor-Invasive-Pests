# Literature Review
* In the literature Review of my PhD Thesis I included a map which was created using location data from Defra: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asian-hornet-uk-sightings/asian-hornet-sightings-recorded-since-2016.
* I included my Microsoft Excel sheet as an example of what my input file looked like and R script in this repository to help with reproducibility of the map for future interceptions of this pest in the UK or other invasive species outbreaks
