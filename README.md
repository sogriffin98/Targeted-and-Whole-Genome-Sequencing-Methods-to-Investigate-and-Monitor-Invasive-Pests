# Genomic Tools to Enable Epidemiological Monitoring of Eukaryotic Pests
This GitHub repository contains all of the scripts and code used during my PhD project titled "Genomic Tools to Enable Epidemiological Monitoring of Eukaryotic Pests" at Newcastle University from September 2022 to July 2026. The code is split into the relevant chapters in the folders of this repository to allow ease of reproducibility. The study species for this research were *Vespa velutina* (yellow legged hornet) and *Meloidogyne fallax* (false Columbia root knot nematode). *V. velutina* is an invasive insect species in the UK which poses a threat to apiculture. *M. fallax* is a plant pest which burrows into the roots of crops causing external galling and necrosis. 

## Literature Review Chapter
* In the literature review, I created a map of the UK with the individual insects and nests found for *Vespa velutina*. 
* I used R studio to create this map based on location data from Defra: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asian-hornet-uk-sightings/asian-hornet-sightings-recorded-since-2016. 
* The script and Microsoft Excel file is in the Literature-Review folder of this repository: ```Mapping_of_Hornets.R``` and ```mapping_of_hornets.xlsx```

## Data Chapter 1a

## Data Chapter 1b

## Data Chapter 1c

## Data Chapter 2: Genome assembly of *Meloidogyne fallax*
* In this data chapter, I created a draft reference genome for *Meloidogyne fallax* or false Columbia root knot nematode.
* The genome was published in the Journal of Nematology: https://doi.org/10.2478/jofnem-2025-0016
* The associated scripts and code is in the Data-Chapter-2 folder of this repository.
