# Genomic Tools to Enable Epidemiological Monitoring of Eukaryotic Pests
This GitHub repository contains all of the scripts and code used during my PhD project on "Genomic Tools to Enable Epidemiological Monitoring of Eukaryotic Pests" at Newcastle University from September 2022 to July 2026. The code is split into the relevant chapters in the folders of this repository to allow ease of reproducibility. The study species for this research were *Vespa velutina* (yellow legged hornet) and *Meloidogyne fallax* (false Columbia root knot nematode). *V. velutina* is an invasive insect species in the UK which poses a threat to apiculture. *M. fallax* is a plant pest which burrows into the roots of crops causing necrosis. 

## Literature Review
* In the literature review, I created a map of the UK with the individual insects and nests found for *Vespa velutina*. 
* I used R studio to create this map based on location data from Defra: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asian-hornet-uk-sightings/asian-hornet-sightings-recorded-since-2016. 
* The script is in the Literature Review folder of this repository.
